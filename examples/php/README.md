# PHP Example

This example uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage dependencies. To get things rolling, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
$ composer install
```

This will install any needed frameworks. You can then run the example:

```bash
$ php example.php
```

### Caveat

You will need to edit [example.php](https://github.com/battis/qdapi/blob/master/examples/php/example.php#L5) to point the `$api` at an existing QDAPI installation!
