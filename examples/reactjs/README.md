# React JS example

This example makes use of the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage dependencies. In the project directory, run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

...to install dependencies. To fire up a test server to see the app do its thing:

```bash
$ npm start
```

...and then point your browser to http://localhost:3000

### Caveat

You will need to edit [App.js](https://github.com/battis/qdapi/blob/master/examples/reactjs/src/components/App.js#L36) to point the `url` at an existing QDAPI installation!
